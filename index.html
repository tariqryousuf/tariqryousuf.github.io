<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> I just wanted to finalize our project idea with you. My partner Mark Geha and I are hoping to create a gesture-recognition application that can recognize various shapes based on a user drawing on a 2D surface. This would be accomplished using the accelerometer data on the BLE Sense, and then subsequently classified. This idea is very similar to the one you presented to me during OH, and after consulting many research papers I think we know an approach. 

    We aren't sure yet about the ability to recognize digits (those seem to be identified using a very different algorithm compared to shapes), so we want to begin with shapes and determine our success from there. We are consulting many research papers to ensure robust classification (not just shapes drawn with our own hands), and collecting enough training data will be a challenge for us. 
    We are going to finalize and polish up our idea for the project proposal due Friday, but I just wanted to inform you of our decision and determine if there are any issues we should be aware of (and if we should meet to discuss it). Thank you again for the guidance you have given us during the OH!
Thank you,
Tariq Yousuf</p>
