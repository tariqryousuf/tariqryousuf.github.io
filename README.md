## Abstract

Gesture Recognition is a emerging field, with a breadth of use ranging from improved human-computer intaractions, medical care, and numerous more applications.
In this project, we are attempting to build a robust, efficent gesture recognition application to allow recognition of shapes drawn on a 2-D surface.
By leveraging the accelerometer and TinyML support built into the Arduiono Nano BLE Sense 33, we hope to be able to recognize many common shapes irrespective of the user.
Digits present another significant challenge, and our ability to accurately and robustly identify digits may be diminished compared to that of shapes.
Thus, we hope to first develop strong recognition of shapes, and then evaluate our model before proceeding towards digits.
